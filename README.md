# Zebrafish Tracking and Path Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on the tracking and path prediction of **zebrafish** for understanding their behavior and movement patterns. The goal is to analyze the zebrafish's movements, which can offer valuable insights into neurological and developmental processes.

### Key Objectives:
- **Tracking** the zebrafish's movement in a 3D space using videos captured from dual cameras.
- **Path prediction** based on the tracked data to estimate the future movement trajectories.
- **Behavioral analysis** for understanding neurological functions in zebrafish.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the project.
- **OpenCV**: Used for computer vision and video processing.
- **PyQt5**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for analysis and data visualization.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **QT Designer**: To design the GUI components.
- **Dual-lens Camera Setup**: Capturing 3D video data of the zebrafish for accurate tracking.
  
## Research Focus
The project is part of ongoing research aimed at understanding the behavioral patterns of zebrafish, a widely used model organism in biological and neurological studies. By tracking their movement, we can gain insights into neurological disorders, developmental processes, and general behavioral studies.

## Features
- **3D Coordinates Extraction**: Extracts the 3D coordinates of the zebrafish from the captured video.
- **Trajectory Mapping**: Generates static and dynamic visualizations of zebrafish trajectories.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Implements real-time tracking and prediction of zebrafish movement patterns.
- **GUI Interface**: An interactive interface to control and monitor tracking, display results, and analyze movement.
